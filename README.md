Finding Parental Relationships
===================================
Finding the parental relationship, having noisy short reads of the genome sequence of men, women, and children was the goal.
The solution is based on genome variations like SNPs(single nucleotide polymorphisms) of each individual using pool sequencing
technique and Maximum Likelihood of each triple.
